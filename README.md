I've started learning C++ I just want to post my programs somewhere which can be useful for someone else or someone can make me advices how to improve them

cal.cpp >> counting BMI/daily calorie intake and warns you if you dont have a normal weight
numg.cpp >> initialize the range between 0 and x after picks a random number and you have to guess it.

I am definitely waiting for program ideas for learning purpose. I want to learn as much as I can but I hope these are going to help for someone else aswell.

Regards,
G.
